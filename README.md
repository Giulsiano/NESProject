# NESProject
Network of Embedded Systems test project

This is the project required by professor Anastasi. Requirements are on the root of the project.
This code has been tested on the Cooja platform only, no real SkyMotes have been used.
For the reader: please be kind, this is an academic code, so if there is something strange in the
code, such as wrong design patterns or anything else, don't send me issues but prefer fork this 
code if you are interested in.

# Description (Brief. Very Brief)
The requirements ask to create a little network of 3 nodes: a central unit, a node near the door
and a node near the gate. The scenario taken in consideration is a SmartHome where the user
mainly interacts with the Central Unit and by means of pressing buttons on the Central Unit the
user can send up to 5 commands to the nodes.
User can also press the button on the Door node to switch on or off lights inside the house.
